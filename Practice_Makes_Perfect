Problem
Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.

Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.

Chef decides to solve at least 1010 problems every week for 4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as P1, P2, P3,P4, output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.

Input Format
There is a single line of input, with 4 integers P1, P2, P3,P4 . These are the number of problems solved by Chef in each of the 4 weeks.

Output Format
Output a single integer in a single line - the number of weeks in which Chef solved at least 10 problems.

Constraints:
1<= P1,P2,P3,P4 <=100
